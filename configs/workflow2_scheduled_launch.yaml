# ============================================================================
# USAGE:
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Create campaign WITH start_time (future activation):
#    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/campaigns" \
#      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
#      -d '{
#        "config_path": "configs/workflow2_scheduled_launch.yaml",
#        "start_time": "2026-03-15T08:00:00"
#      }'
#
#    This will:
#    - Create campaign in PAUSED status
#    - Set AdSet start_time in Meta API to 2026-03-15T08:00:00+0800
#    - Schedule automatic activation at that time
#
# 2. Check scheduled job:
#    cat data/schedules.json | jq '.[] | select(.campaign_id=="scheduled_launch_001")'
#
# 3. Cancel schedule if needed:
#    curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/campaigns/scheduled_launch_001/schedule"
#
# 4. Check status on launch day:
#    curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/campaigns/scheduled_launch_001" | jq '.status'
#
# ============================================================================
# BEFORE USING:
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Update campaign_id to be unique (e.g., "scheduled_launch_002")
# 2. Update video file path if using different video
# 3. Update ad copy for your campaign
# 4. Update destination_url to your landing page
# 5. Set appropriate daily_budget for production
# 6. Choose your start_time (GMT+8 Singapore time)
