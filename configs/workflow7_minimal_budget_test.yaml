# ============================================================================
# USAGE:
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Create test campaign:
#    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/campaigns" \
#      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
#      -d '{"config_path": "configs/workflow7_minimal_budget_test.yaml"}'
#
# 2. Activate immediately for testing:
#    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/campaigns/creative_test_001/activate"
#
# 3. Monitor performance for 1-2 hours
#    - Check Meta Ads Manager for results
#    - Evaluate CTR, CPM, engagement
#
# 4. Decision:
#    If results are GOOD:
#      - Pause this test campaign
#      - Create production campaign with same creative and higher budget
#
#    If results are POOR:
#      - Pause in Meta Ads Manager
#      - Try different creative
#
# ============================================================================
# BEFORE USING:
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Update campaign_id to be unique (e.g., "creative_test_002")
# 2. Update video file path to your test creative
# 3. Keep budget LOW (100-500 cents) for testing
# 4. Use test destination URL if available
# 5. Monitor closely after activation
# 6. Don't let test campaigns run indefinitely!
#
# ============================================================================
# BEST PRACTICES:
# ============================================================================
#
# - Test ONE variable at a time (creative, copy, audience, etc.)
# - Run test for at least 1-2 hours to gather data
# - Compare against baseline/existing campaigns
# - Document results before pausing
# - Scale winners quickly to production budgets
